\brief      Virtual Interfaces on Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)
\details

The **Virtual Interfaces** in Arm FVPs implement various CPU peripherals that allow to use external resources for stimulating the firmware application. Following interfaces are available and explained in details in corresponding sections:

  - The \ref arm_vio interface controls simple binary state I/O such as LED and switches.
  - The \ref arm_vsi provides up to 8 channels for data streaming.
  - The \ref arm_vsocket connects the user application to [BSD sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) on the Host computer for IP network connectivity.

Both \ref arm_vio "VIO" and \ref arm_vsi "VSI" connect to Python and enable flexible scripting for test automation.
