\brief      Use Cases for Virtual Streaming Interface (VSI)
\details

\ref arm_vsi is a general purpose peripheral for implementing data streaming support on Arm FVPs.

\ref arm_vsi_audio implements VSI-based audio data streaming with local audio wave file and so simulates audio I/O peripheral in the system.

\ref arm_vsi_video implements VSI-based video data streaming with local video or image files. Alternatively, PC's camera can be used as video input and PC's display as video output.

Other examples for VSI peripherals will be added in future as well.

\brief Audio file streaming interface
\details

Audio streaming use case is implemented for Arm FVPs based on the general-purpose \ref arm_vsi.

The use of common audio driver API simplifies re-targeting of the application code between virtual and physical devices.
Currently audio driver implementations and examples are available for the following platforms:
  - Arm FVPs using \ref arm_vsi_api "VSI" with an interface to a Python test script that streams local *.wav file.
  - NXP IMXRT1064 and IMXRT1050 evaluation boards that use microphone for audio input.
  .
and support for other hardware platforms can be added following the same concept.

[Micro Speech Example](../../examples/html/MicroSpeech.html) project demonstrates use of this audio driver in both the AVH test environment and on the physical evaluation boards.

The table below references the files that implement the audio peripheral:

\ingroup arm_vsi_audio
\brief Audio Driver API functions.
\details

@{
\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Initialize (AudioDrv_Event_t cb_event)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Initialize initializes the Audio interface over VSI peripheral. It is called when the middleware component starts
operation.

The function performs the following operations:
  - Initializes the required resources of the audio interface.
  - Registers the \ref AudioDrv_Event_t callback function.

The parameter \em cb_event is a pointer to the \ref AudioDrv_Event_t callback function; use a NULL pointer when no callback signals are required.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : audio interface is successfully initialized.


\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Uninitialize (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Uninitialize de-initializes the resources of Audio interface.

It is called when the middleware component stops operation and releases the software resources used by the interface.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : audio interface is successfully de-initialized.

\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Configure (uint32_t interface, uint32_t channels, uint32_t sample_bits, uint32_t sample_rate)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Configure configures audio interface according to specified arguments.

\em interface configures the audio interface either for input (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_RX) or output (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX).

\em channels, \em sample_bits, \em sample_rate define configuration parameters.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : configuration completed successfully.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_PARAMETER : invalid argument values. Returned in the following cases:
      - \em interface is not \ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX or \ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX
      - \em channel is &lt;0 or &gt;32
      - \em sample_bits is &lt;8 or &gt;32
      - \em sample_rate is 0
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED : requested configuration is not supported by the driver.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR : audio control is already enabled with \ref AudioDrv_Control.

\fn int32_t AudioDrv_SetBuf (uint32_t interface, void *buf, uint32_t block_num, uint32_t block_size)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_SetBuf assigns DMA buffer to the audio driver interface.

\em interface specifies whether the buffer is used for input (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_RX) or output (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX).

\em buf points to the memory buffer. \em block_num and \em block_size define buffer configuration. Note that the memory allocated for the buffer shall be at least \em block_num*block_size bytes.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : buffer is set correctly.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_PARAMETER : invalid \em interface value.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED : requested buffer configuration is not supported by the driver.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR : returned in the following cases:
      - audio driver  is not initialized with \ref AudioDrv_Initialize
      - audio control is already enabled with \ref AudioDrv_Control

\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Control (uint32_t control)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Control controls the Audio interface.

The parameter \em control specifies the operation as described in the table.

<table class="cmtable" summary="">
<tr><th> Parameter \em control </th><th> Bit </th><th> Description </th></tr>
<tr><td> \ref AUDIO_DRV_CONTROL_TX_ENABLE. When executed, a timer is configured that periodically sends event to python interface for delivering the audio data.</td>

\fn uint32_t AudioDrv_GetTxCount (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_GetTxCount returns the number of the currently transmitted data items.

\fn uint32_t AudioDrv_GetRxCount (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_GetRxCount returns the number of the currently received data items.

\fn AudioDrv_Status_t AudioDrv_GetStatus (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_GetStatus retrieves the current Audio interface status.

\typedef AudioDrv_Event_t
\details
Provides the typedef for the event callback function <b>AudioDrv_Event (uint32 event)</b> to be registered with \ref AudioDrv_Initialize.

The parameter \em event indicates the reported event(s) that occurred during driver operation.
Each event is encoded in a separate bit so it is possible to signal multiple events within the same call.
\ref AUDIO_DRV_EVENT_RX_DATA "AUDIO_DRV_EVENT_..." definitions list the events that can be reported.
