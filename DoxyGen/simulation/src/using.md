\page Using \prj_name Targets

This section describes how to use the **\prj_name Targets**.  These simulation models are based on the [Arm Fast Models Fix Virtual Platforms](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100966/1115/Getting-Started-with-Fixed-Virtual-Platforms/Ethernet-with-VE-FVPs) and additional extensions for 
Virtual Peripherals (\ref arm_vio_api "VIO", \ref arm_vsi_api "VSI", \ref arm_vsocket_api "VSocket") and the Event Recorder.
