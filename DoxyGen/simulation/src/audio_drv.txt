\brief Audio file streaming interface
\details

Audio streaming use case is implemented for Arm FVPs based on the general-purpose \ref arm_vsi.

The use of common audio driver API simplifies re-targeting of the application code between virtual and physical devices.
Currently audio driver implementations and examples are available for the following platforms:
  - Arm FVPs using \ref arm_vsi_api "VSI" with an interface to a Python test script that streams local *.wav file.
  - NXP IMXRT1064 and IMXRT1050 evaluation boards that use microphone for audio input.
  .
and support for other hardware platforms can be added following the same concept.

[Micro Speech Example](../../examples/html/MicroSpeech.html) project demonstrates use of this audio driver in both the AVH test environment and on the physical evaluation boards.

The table below references the files that implement the audio peripheral:

\ingroup arm_vsi_audio
\brief Audio Driver API functions.
\details

@{
\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Initialize (AudioDrv_Event_t cb_event)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Initialize initializes the Audio interface over VSI peripheral. It is called when the middleware component starts
operation.

The function performs the following operations:
  - Initializes the required resources of the audio interface.
  - Registers the \ref AudioDrv_Event_t callback function.

The parameter \em cb_event is a pointer to the \ref AudioDrv_Event_t callback function; use a NULL pointer when no callback signals are required.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : audio interface is successfully initialized.


\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Uninitialize (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Uninitialize de-initializes the resources of Audio interface.

It is called when the middleware component stops operation and releases the software resources used by the interface.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : audio interface is successfully de-initialized.

\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Configure (uint32_t interface, uint32_t channels, uint32_t sample_bits, uint32_t sample_rate)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Configure configures audio interface according to specified arguments.

\em interface configures the audio interface either for input (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_RX) or output (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX).

\em channels, \em sample_bits, \em sample_rate define configuration parameters.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : configuration completed successfully.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_PARAMETER : invalid argument values. Returned in the following cases:
      - \em interface is not \ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX or \ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX
      - \em channel is &lt;0 or &gt;32
      - \em sample_bits is &lt;8 or &gt;32
      - \em sample_rate is 0
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED : requested configuration is not supported by the driver.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR : audio control is already enabled with \ref AudioDrv_Control.

\fn int32_t AudioDrv_SetBuf (uint32_t interface, void *buf, uint32_t block_num, uint32_t block_size)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_SetBuf assigns DMA buffer to the audio driver interface.

\em interface specifies whether the buffer is used for input (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_RX) or output (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_TX).

\em buf points to the memory buffer. \em block_num and \em block_size define buffer configuration. Note that the memory allocated for the buffer shall be at least \em block_num*block_size bytes.

Possible return values:
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_OK : buffer is set correctly.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_PARAMETER : invalid \em interface value.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED : requested buffer configuration is not supported by the driver.
    - \ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR : returned in the following cases:
      - audio driver  is not initialized with \ref AudioDrv_Initialize
      - audio control is already enabled with \ref AudioDrv_Control

\fn int32_t AudioDrv_Control (uint32_t control)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_Control controls the Audio interface.

The parameter \em control specifies the operation as described in the table.

<table class="cmtable" summary="">
<tr><th> Parameter \em control </th><th> Bit </th><th> Description </th></tr>
<tr><td> \ref AUDIO_DRV_CONTROL_TX_ENABLE. When executed, a timer is configured that periodically sends event to python interface for delivering the audio data.</td>
    <td> 0 </td>
    <td> Enable transmit operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td> \ref AUDIO_DRV_CONTROL_RX_ENABLE. When executed, a timer is configured that periodically sends event to python interface for delivering the audio data.</td>
    <td> 1 </td>
    <td> Enable receive operation. When executed, a timer is configured that periodically sends event to python interface for retrieving the audio data.</td></tr>

\fn uint32_t AudioDrv_GetTxCount (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_GetTxCount returns the number of the currently transmitted data items.

\fn uint32_t AudioDrv_GetRxCount (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_GetRxCount returns the number of the currently received data items.

\fn AudioDrv_Status_t AudioDrv_GetStatus (void)
\details
The function \b AudioDrv_GetStatus retrieves the current Audio interface status.

\typedef AudioDrv_Event_t
\details
Provides the typedef for the event callback function <b>AudioDrv_Event (uint32 event)</b> to be registered with \ref AudioDrv_Initialize.

The parameter \em event indicates the reported event(s) that occurred during driver operation.
Each event is encoded in a separate bit so it is possible to signal multiple events within the same call.
\ref AUDIO_DRV_EVENT_RX_DATA "AUDIO_DRV_EVENT_..." definitions list the events that can be reported.

\brief Audio Driver API Definitions
\details
Audio driver provides various definitions to simplify use of its \ref audio_drv_functions :
 - Control parameter definitions (\ref AUDIO_DRV_CONTROL_TX_ENABLE "AUDIO_DRV_CONTROL_...") can be used in \ref AudioDrv_Control function.
 - Interface definitions (\ref AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_RX "AUDIO_DRV_INTERFACE_...") can be used in \ref AudioDrv_Configure, \ref AudioDrv_SetBuf functions.
 - Error codes definitions (\ref AUDIO_DRV_OK,\ref AUDIO_DRV_ERROR "AUDIO_DRV_ERROR_...") map the status results that can be returned by \ref audio_drv_functions.
 - Event definitions \ref AUDIO_DRV_EVENT_RX_DATA "AUDIO_DRV_EVENT_..." list the events that can be reported via callback function \ref AudioDrv_Event_t.
