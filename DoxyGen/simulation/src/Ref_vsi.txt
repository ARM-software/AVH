\brief Data streaming interface
\details

The **Virtual Streaming Interface (VSI)** is a flexible memory-mapped peripheral available in Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs). It can be used to simulate data streaming interfaces such as audio, video and various sensors often found in IoT and Machine-Learning applications.
The VSI is provided in 8 independent instances that can be used in parallel for multi-channel input/ouput interfaces.

Figure below illustrates the concept behind the VSI on Arm FVPs.

- On the application firmware side a peripheral driver uses the \ref arm_vsi_api "VSI registers" in the FVP model to simulate peripheral operation for a target use case.
By relying on common driver APIs the same application-level code can be reused for FVPs and real hardware targets.

- Read/write accesses to the VSI peripheral registers in the FVP trigger execution of corresponding callback functions in 
the \ref arm_vsi_py "VSI Python scripts" that implement peripheral behavior in the target scenario.

- An FVP model can be run on a Windows or Linux host and executes the target firmware application image.
The path to the VSI python scripts shall be provided to the FVP using the command-line option `-V`, or `--v_path`, see \ref Execution.

Section \ref arm_vsi_cases explains in details the reference implementations of VSI-based peripherals.
Specifically \ref arm_vsi_audio implementing audio streaming input from a local audio wave file and \ref arm_vsi_video implementing video streaming from a local video or image file.

Access to the VSI peripherals is defined in the following files:

File                             | Description
:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------
./interface/include/arm_vsi.h    | \ref arm_vsi_api "VSI API" header file
./interface/python/arm_vsi0.py   | \ref arm_vsi_py "VSI Python interface" script template for instance 0
  :                              |   :
./interface/python/arm_vsi7.py   | \ref arm_vsi_py "VSI Python interface" script template for instance 7

An example flow for using the VSI peripheral is shown on the figure below:

\brief Python environment for Arm FVPs
\details

Arm FVPs require an installation of <b>Python 3.9</b> for running the Python virtual interfaces. If you are using a Windows machine you can use an embedded Python installation in FVPs root directory, otherwise a system installation is required.
Additional Python packages can be added using \em pip. In case you are using embedded Python installation see section: \ref embedded-pip-vsi

# Known issues
Some Python packages can't be imported directly in the Python virtual interfaces, because they are incompatible with Python sub-interpreters (e.g. \em numpy). Possible workaround for this issue is to split the Python module into client and server scripts.

# Install additional packages in embedded Python {#embedded-pip-vsi}
By default the embedded Python installation on Windows does not support installation of new packages using pip. To enable installing new packages follow the steps described below.
- Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) to the FVPs root directory.
- Uncomment the following line in the \b python39._pth file.
  \code {.sh}
  import site
  \endcode
- Open command prompt in the FVPs root directory and run the following command.
  \code {.sh}
  .\python.exe get-pip.py
  \endcode
- Install new packages using:
  \code {.sh}
  .\python.exe -m pip install <package>
  \endcode
  The packages will be installed in <code>Lib\\site-packages</code> subfolder.
