[Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH)](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware) covers various solutions for software development on Arm-based processors using virtual targets. This includes virtual simulation models, their cloud-native deployments and integrations with development tools.

AVH supports the software development cycle of embedded, IoT, and ML applications and provides essential components for effective integration into Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery ([CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)) and [MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps) development flows.

# AVH Models {#avh_models}

AVH simulation models enable execution of software programs on virtual targets. Two different AVH modelling technologies are available:

  <h2>AVH Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)</h2>

  - Precise simulation models of Arm Cortex-M based reference platforms, such as Corstone-315/310/300. Learn more at [Simulation](../../simulation/html/index.html).
  - Available for cloud-native and desktop environments. See [Infrastructure](../../infrastructure/html/index.html) for details.

  <h2>AVH Corellium models</h2>

   - Functionally accurate virtual representations of popular IoT development boards and selected Arm reference platforms:
     - Cortex-A based systems with Linux OS support, such as Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX.
     - Selected Cortex-M based kits.
   - Software binary-compatible with the hardware targets.
   - Available via [app.avh.arm.com](https://app.avh.arm.com/) cloud platform. Read more in [AVH Users's Guide](https://developer.arm.com/docs/107660).

# AVH Integrations {#avh_integrations}

Arm Virtual Hardware models integrate well in various tools and services for development, debug, testing as well as CI/CD and MLOps flows. AVH is already  supported within many Arm tools, as well as by third-party vendors.

The integration approach depends on the modelling technology:
- AVH FVP models are standalone programs that gets executed in the target environment. See [Infrastructure](../../infrastructure/html/index.html) for more details.
- AVH Corellium models are cloud-native and gets integrated via REST API and SSH connections. See [AVH Users's Guide](https://developer.arm.com/docs/107660)

# AVH Developer Resources {#avh_dev}

Various Resources explain how to integrate Arm Virtual Hardware into workflows common for generic embedded software development, CI testing and MLOps.

Usage examples show typical use cases and range from audio processing, ML algorithm testing, up to IoT applications that interface to Cloud Service providers and Over-the-Air Firware Updates (OTAU).

**This documentation** is largely dedicated to the **AVH FVPs** and has following sections that can be accessed as document tabs as well:

Section                                                    | Description

# Test without Hardware {#No_Hardware}

AVH allows to verify your code without the need for physical hardware which provides a robust test environment that enables:
 - Early software development for faster time-to-market
 - Select optimal target device once the software workload is analysed
 - Re-target applications to production hardware with driver abstractions

# Verify Correctness {#Verify}

**Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)** are Arm simulation models validated with the same process as the CPU IP. Specially it allows you to:
 - Perform algorithm testing with identical logical behaviour of the target device
 - Precisely repeat complex input patterns in CI/CD test environments
 - Analyse software behaviour with event annotations

# Evaluate Performance {#Evaluate}

Software algorithms for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) or Machine Learning (ML) frequently require significant CPU resources and need to be optimized for the target hardware. Comparing performance of such "load heavy" algorithms requires that they can be automatically executed with different configurations parameters but using identical input. 

**Arm Virtual Hardware Services** allows users to test their programs at scale with reproducible input patterns and so validate and optimize application performance which allows you to:
 - Compare speed of different implementations of an algorithm
 - Identify timing issues during system integration
 - Optimize resources (i.e. data buffers) towards application requirements

# Continuous Testing {#CI}

Applying continuous integration work flows for embedded applications can be complicated by the specifics of development environments and the need of executing the program on target hardware. So the development teams are often reluctant to spend initial effort setting up the continuous integration (CI) workflow even though the long-term benefits are undisputed as shown on the Figure below

![Comparison of test efforts in CI and no CI workflows](./images/effort_comparison.png)

**Arm Virtual Hardware** simplifies the setup and use of CI workflows in embedded projects.

For unit and integration tests virtual targets offer additional advantages over hardware, including:
 - **Speed** - no overhead for flashing the application on physical hardware. This saves time on small and fast unit tests. 
 - **Scale** - virtual platforms can scale to run many tests in parallel. This makes virtual platforms more cost-effective than a farm of physical hardware. 
 - **Maintenance** – unlike physical hardware, virtual platforms do not overheat, wear out from overuse, break from misuse, or use physical space and resources. 
 - **Upgrades** – virtual platforms can be adapted and re-configured to match corresponding changes to the underlying hardware platform that is under development. These types of changes can be costly or impossible with physical hardware.
